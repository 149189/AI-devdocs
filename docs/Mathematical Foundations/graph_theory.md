# Graph Theory

Focuses on relationships represented as nodes and edges.

## Basics
- **Graph**: G = (V, E)
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Encodes connections.
- **Paths & Cycles**: Node sequences.
- **Centrality**: Importance of nodes.

## ML Applications
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
- Social network analysis.
- Knowledge graphs.
