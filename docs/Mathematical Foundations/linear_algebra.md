# Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is the study of vectors, vector spaces, and linear transformations — essential for ML models.

## Key Concepts
- **Vector**: An ordered list of numbers.
- **Matrix**: A 2D array representing linear transformations.
- **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**: Describe directions of stretching under transformation.
- **Dot Product**: Measures similarity.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Composes transformations.

## ML Applications
- Representing datasets as matrices.
- PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Neural network weight matrices.
