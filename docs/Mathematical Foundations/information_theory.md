# Information Theory

Quantifies information, uncertainty, and relationships between variables.

## Core Ideas
- **Entropy (H)**: Measure of uncertainty.
- **KL Divergence**: Distance between probability distributions.
- **Mutual Information**: Shared information between variables.

## ML Applications
- Decision trees (information gain).
- Variational Autoencoders.
- Regularization and compression.
