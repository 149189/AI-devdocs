# Game Theory

Studies interactions among rational agents with competing interests.

## Concepts
- **Nash Equilibrium**: No player benefits by changing strategy alone.
- **Zero-sum Games**: One's gain equals another's loss.
- **Payoff Matrix**: Represents strategies and outcomes.

## ML Applications
- GANs (Generator vs. Discriminator).
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning.
