# Control Theory

Deals with influencing system behavior to reach desired outcomes.

## Concepts
- **Feedback Loop**: Adjusts system based on output.
- **PID Controller**: Proportional, Integral, Derivative control.
- **Stability**: System returns to equilibrium after disturbance.

## ML Applications
- Reinforcement learning (policy optimization).
- Robotics (trajectory tracking).
- Adaptive systems.
