# Dynamical Systems

Describes how systems evolve over time using differential equations.

## Key Concepts
- **State Space**: All possible system states.
- **Fixed Point**: System remains unchanged.
- **Chaos**: Sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

## ML Applications
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- Time-series forecasting.
- Stability analysis.
